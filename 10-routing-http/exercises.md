# Practical part

**Before you start please check if you have all of the [prerequirements](https://github.com/ng-slo/workshop/tree/master/08-component2#prerequirements) done.**

## Angular component 2

### Exercise 1
Create a new welcome page (`WelcomeComponent`) and set this new component as a root component. Also add a title to the `AppComponent`. Don't forget to remove `h1` title from the `FamilyTreeComponent`.

### Exercise 2
Add new components `LoginComponent`. For now just keep default text that is generated by Angular CLI.

### Exercise 3
Create router module and add `WelcomeComponent` as a default path. Don't forget to remove `<welcome></welcome>` from the `app.component.html`.

### Exercise 4
Add a new path `login` into the router module (linked to the `LoginComponent`). Add this link to the bottom of `WelcomeComponent`. You should also crate a path `family` which should display `FamilyTreeComponent` component.

### Exercise 5
In `LoginComponent` create a form that has two inputs (email and password) and a login button. When you click on a login button you should send a `POST` request to the `https://reqres.in/api/login` and check if you receive a token back. If you receive a token redirect application to the `family` path. Credentials used for a login can be dummy as long as you enter a valid email and password.

### Exercise 6
Create a service `LoginService` that will store if the user is logged in or not (default value is false). When login is successful you should set the `login` value in `LoginService` to true. Using this new service to create a router guard that will protect `family` path from an unauthorised user.
